# bootstrap-modal-carousel

This set of JavaScript and CSS extensions to Twitter Boostrap was made in order to display a carousel in fullscreen. I decided to extend the libraries step by step by separate the feature I needed, which resulted in the following independent "packages" :

1. the ability to detach a content to a modal box
2. make a modal into fullscreen mode
3. a carousel which fits itself according to the different images and captions
4. and one to link them all


**Feel free to use them and/or contribute to make them better.**


## Usage

In the "dist" folder, you'll find the CSS and JS assets. To quickly use the plugins, I also packaged and minified versions.
